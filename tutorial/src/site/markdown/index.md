<head><title>About</title></head>

This module contains an IP Multicast implementation, that provides
basic IP Multicast based group communication using `java.net.MulticastSocket`.
This implementation is not very useful by itself, but a good starting point for
developing bindings for new group communication toolkits.  

To use, [add this package as a runtime dependency](dependency-info.html) to your build system. jGCS configuration objects are found in the [net.sf.jgcs.ip](apidocs/net/sf/jgcs/ip/package-summary.html) package.
