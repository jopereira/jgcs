## History

This is a fork of [jGCS 0.6](http://jgcs.sf.net). It simplifies the interface, fixes several problems, and adds support for current versions of communication toolkits and Corosync. A backwards compatible version with some minor fixes is still available in [GitHub](https://github.com/jopereira/jgcs/tree/compat-0.6.x).

The rationale for jGCS is explained in a [research paper](http://jgcs.sourceforge.net/_Media/doa-06-13.pdf). Research leading to jGCS was partially funded by the European Commission under the project [GORDA - Open Replication of Databases (FP6-IST2-004758)](http://gorda.di.uminho.pt/), at FCUL and U. Minho.
