All rights reserved.

1. Overview
-----------

The jGCS library provides a generic interface for Group
Communication. This interface can be used by applications that need
primitives from simple IP Multicast group communication to virtual
synchrony or atomic broadcast. Its a common interface to several
existing toolkits that provide different APIs.

This library contains an IP Multicast implementation, that provides
basic IP Multicast based group communication. 

2. Compile
----------

To compile this distribution use the Apache Ant and Ivy. Targets are:

* publish - resolve dependencies, build, and install jar files in local repository
* clean - remove all generated and downloaded files

3. Credits
----------

The IP Multicast implementation of the jGCS service was developed by:

 - Jose' Pereira <jop@di.uminho.pt>
 - Nuno Carvalho <nunomrc@di.fc.ul.pt>

Research leading to this implementation was partially funded by the
European Union. People involved were N. Carvalho, J. Pereira,
L. Rodrigues and R. Oliveira.
