The jGCS library provides a generic interface for Group
Communication. This interface can be used by applications that need
primitives from simple IP Multicast group communication to virtual
synchrony or atomic broadcast. Its a common interface to several
existing toolkits that provide different APIs.

This library contains an IP Multicast implementation, that provides
basic IP Multicast based group communication. 

2. Compile
