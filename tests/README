This package contains a set of tests that check if different implementations
are consistent, mainly, regarding to error reporting and typical
initialization and shutdown sequences. They are not unit tests, as 
protocols are not mocked, and are a source of non-determinism.
They make use of TestNG, JMockit, and are configured with JNDI.
See samples/ for configuration instructions.

These tests are developed and maintained by J. Pereira at:

 http://github.com/jopereira/jgcs

They are released under a BSD-style licence.
See COPYING for licensing details.
