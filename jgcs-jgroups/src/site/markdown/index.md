## JGroups binding

This module contains a JGroups implementation, that provides group
communication with the Quality of Service defined on
configuration. With this implementation, the application can use
simple group communication, group membership, virtual sysnchrony or
atomic broadcast. Please see the [JGroups home page](http://www.jgroups.org) for further details.

To use, [add this package as a runtime dependency](dependency-info.html) to your build system. jGCS configuration objects are found in the [net.sf.jgcs.jgroups](apidocs/net/sf/jgcs/jgroups/package-summary.html) package.
