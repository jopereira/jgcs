1. Overview
-----------

The jGCS library provides a generic interface for Group
Communication. This interface can be used by applications that need
primitives from simple IP Multicast group communication to virtual
synchrony or atomic broadcast. Its a common interface to several
existing toolkits that provide different APIs.

This library contains a JGroups implementation, that provides group
communication with the Quality of Service defined on
configuration. With this implementation, the application can use
simple group communication, group membership, virtual sysnchrony or
atomic broadcast. Please see the JGroups home page for further details:
