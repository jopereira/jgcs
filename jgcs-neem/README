The jGCS library provides a generic interface for Group
Communication. This interface can be used by applications that need
primitives from simple IP Multicast group communication to virtual
synchrony or atomic broadcast. Its a common interface to several
existing toolkits that provide different APIs.

This library contains a NeEM implementation, that provides group
communication based on epidemic broadcast. Please see the NeEM home
page for more details: http://neem.sf.net
