This is an evolution of jGCS, the generic interface for 
group communication in Java, providing access to multiple toolkits, 
such as Appia, JGroups, Corosync, or Spread, through a common interface.

The API is changed from version 0.6.x.  I still maintain a backwards
compatible jGCS at http://github.com/jopereira/jgcs-0.6. The main
changes are:

 - Java generics where appropriate
 - simplification of the API, eliminating redundant functionality

To compile and use:

 - execute ant publish in jgcs/
 - execute ant publish in desired bindings, e.g. jgcs-jgroups/
 
Desired artifacts are then available at your local Ivy repository. 
See samples/ directory for an usage example.

Current source is at https://github.com/jopereira/jgcs.

Licenses for each sub-package differ and can be found in each 
sub-directory.
