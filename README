This is a simplified distribution of jGCS, the generic interface for 
group communication in Java. The original and more information can be 
found at http://jgcs.sf.net. This API is unchanged. Main changes are: 
new build system with Ivy for dependency resolution and minor changes 
to bindings to use updated versions of protocols. 

To compile and use:

 - execute ant publish in jgcs/
 - execute ant publish in desired bindings, e.g. jgcs-jgroups/
 
Desired artifacts are then available at your local Ivy repository. 
See samples/ directory for an usage example.

Current source is at https://github.com/jopereira/jgcs.

Licenses for each sub-package differ and can be found in each 
sub-directory.
