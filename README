This is a simplified distribution of jGCS, the generic interface for 
group communication in Java, providing access to multiple toolkits, 
such as Appia, JGroups, Corosync, or Spread, through a common interface.

The original SVN repository and more information can be found at 
http://jgcs.sf.net. Main changes are:

	- a new Corosync / Closed Process Group (CPG) binding using JNI
	- a new ZooKeeper binding, usable only for membership
	- minor changes to bindings to use updated versions of protocols
	- new build system with Ivy for dependency resolution;
	
The API is unchanged from version 0.6.1.

To compile and use:

 - execute ant publish in jgcs/
 - execute ant publish in desired bindings, e.g. jgcs-jgroups/
 
Desired artifacts are then available at your local Ivy repository. 
See samples/ directory for an usage example.

Current source is at https://github.com/jopereira/jgcs.

Licenses for each sub-package differ and can be found in each 
sub-directory.
