This is an evolution of jGCS, the generic interface for group communication
in Java, providing access to multiple toolkits, such as Appia, JGroups,
Corosync, or Spread, through a common interface.

The API in version 0.7 has changed from version 0.6. I still maintain a backwards
compatible jGCS in branch compat-0.6.x, but it will be not further developed.
Current source is at https://github.com/jopereira/jgcs (master branch).

The main changes in version 0.7 are:

 - Java generics are used where appropriate
 - simplification of the API, eliminating redundant functionality

To compile and use:

 - execute ant publish in jgcs/
 - execute ant publish in desired bindings, e.g. jgcs-jgroups/
 
Desired artifacts are then available at your local Ivy repository. 
See samples/ directory for an usage example.

Licenses for each sub-package differ and can be found in each 
sub-directory.
