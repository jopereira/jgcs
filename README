This is an evolution of jGCS, the generic interface for group communication in
Java, providing access to multiple toolkits, such as JGroups, Corosync, or Spread,
through a common interface.

To build, first run `mvn install` on the top-level project. Then on each desired binding.

See Maven generated documentation at http://jopereira.github.io/jgcs for details.
