This is an evolution of jGCS, the generic interface for group communication
in Java, providing access to multiple toolkits, such as Appia, JGroups,
Corosync, or Spread, through a common interface.

The original version of JGCS (currently at version 0.6) is found at
http://jgcs.sf.net. The design rationale is explained in a paper at
http://jgcs.sourceforge.net/_Media/doa-06-13.pdf.

The API in version 0.7 has changed from version 0.6. I still maintain a backwards
compatible jGCS in branch compat-0.6.x, but it will not be further developed.
Current source is at https://github.com/jopereira/jgcs (master branch).

The main changes in version 0.7 are:

 - simplification of the API, eliminating redundant functionality (see API
 documentation and git log for porting instructions)
 - removal of support for legacy JGroups 2.x and Spread 3.x
 - Java generics are used where appropriate
 - refactoring of service provider classes in spi package
 - implementation and test of close() method in all protocols and sessions
 - major cleanup of synchronization and exception handling
 - many minor fixes, for instance, by using FindBugs
 - consistent sematics of implementations checked with tests
 - much improved JGroups and Corosync bindings

To compile and use:

 - execute ant publish in jgcs/
 - execute ant publish in desired bindings, e.g. jgcs-jgroups/
 
Desired artifacts are then available at your local Ivy repository. 
See samples/ directory for an usage example.

Licenses for each sub-package differ and can be found in each 
sub-directory.
