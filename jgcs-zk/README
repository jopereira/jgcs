Implementation of jGCS on ZooKeeper - Group Communication Service

1. Overview
-----------

The jGCS library provides a generic interface for Group
Communication. This interface can be used by applications that need
primitives from simple IP Multicast group communication to virtual
synchrony or atomic broadcast. Its a common interface to several
existing toolkits that provide different APIs.

This binding is a simple group communication protocol built on ZooKeeper, 
implementing the traditional virtually synchronous group communication 
model. This includes view synchrony with sending view delivery and 
totally ordered multicast.

WARNING: This binding should not be used as a multicast protocol, 
since it makes a write-intensive use of ZooKeeper. Please use other 
JGCS binding for that purpose. Using it only for keeping membership 
should be ok.

Otherwise, regard it just as (i) an exercise on how the good old 
virtual synchrony maps to the new abstraction and (maybe) how to 
program with ZooKeeper; (ii) a toolkit whose API is very simple and 
directly matches the theoretical literature, for use in classes and 
labs. It is currently being used with both these purposes at the U. 
Minho. The view-synchrony implementation on ZooKeeper was original 
published at https://gitorious.org/groupz.

2. Compile
----------

To compile this distribution use the Apache Ant and Ivy. Targets are:

* publish - resolve dependencies, build, and install jar files in local repository
* clean - remove all generated and downloaded files

3. Credits
----------

This implementation was developed and is maintained by J. Pereira at:

 http://github.com/jopereira/jgcs

It was based on research partially funded by the European Union. People
involved were N. Carvalho, J. Pereira, L. Rodrigues and R. Oliveira.
