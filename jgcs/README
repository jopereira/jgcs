jGCS: Group Communication Service

1. Overview
-----------

The jGCS library provides a generic interface for Group
Communication. This interface can be used by applications that need
primitives from simple IP Multicast group communication to virtual
synchrony or atomic broadcast. Its a common interface to several
existing toolkits that provide different APIs.

The jGCS library implements also a new concept of providing a group
communication service. Using the notion of inversion of control
pattern, this service provides the separation of configuration and
use. Provides also modularity, since applications use a common API
that can be implemented using different solutions. The solution that
will be used by an application is defined on configuration time.

This service supports the following notions:

* Support for data and membership;

* Support for peer groups and multicast groups;

* Usable from IP Multicast to VSC. It can also be usable for
  autonomous membership services;

* High concurrency/low latency/latency hiding: support for optimistic
  deliveries and semantic protocols;

* Container-managed concurrency: it is up to the application decide
  the thread policy to receive messages (blocking or concurrent
  non-blocking).


2. Compile
----------

To compile this distribution use the Apache Ant and Ivy.  Targets are:

* publish - resolve dependencies, build, and install jar files in local repository
* clean - remove all generated and downloaded files

3. Credits
----------

This implementation of the jGCS service was developed by:

 - Nuno Carvalho <nunomrc@di.fc.ul.pt>
 - Jose' Pereira <jop@di.uminho.pt>

Research leading to the jGCS service was partially funded by the
European Union. People involved were N. Carvalho, J. Pereira,
A. Pinto and L. Rodrigues.
