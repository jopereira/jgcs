  This package defines the basic interface for group membership. It is composed by a protocol that
  represents the toolkit that implements the interface, a GroupConfiguration that represents a configuration
  that is toolkit specific, and a pair of control and data sessions. The control session defines what can be 
  done and notified to manage a group. The data session defines interfaces to send and receive messages.
