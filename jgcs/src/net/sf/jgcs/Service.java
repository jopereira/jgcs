/**
 * 
 * This class defines a Service.
 * 
 * A Service is some functionality that the channel needs to provide to the application.
 * One example is the optimistic total order. If an application creates a channel that provides
 * optimistic total order, the application will receive the message payload with out guarantees and
 * will be notified later about optimistic delivery, regular delivery, uniform delivery, etc.
 * These notifications must implement this interface.
 * 
 * All related services must be comparable with each other (e.g. uniform delivery is a stronger service than
 * regular delivery, so if the message is uniform, it's also regular and optimistic 
 * -- optimistic lower than regular lower than uniform).
