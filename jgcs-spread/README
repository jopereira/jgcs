Spread implementation of jGCS - Group Communication Service

1. Overview
-----------

The jGCS library provides a generic interface for Group
Communication. This interface can be used by applications that need
primitives from simple IP Multicast group communication to virtual
synchrony or atomic broadcast. Its a common interface to several
existing toolkits that provide different APIs.

This library contains a Spread/FlushSpread implementation, that provides
group communication with the Quality of Service defined on
configuration. This means that with this implementation, the
application can use group communication with membership, and several
different properties for message delivery. Please see the Spread home
page for further details: http://www.spread.org

This implementation is based on the (now obsolete) Java Native
Interface (JNI) binding to Spread and FlushSpread created by
Jose' Pereira.

2. Compile
----------

To compile this distribution use the Apache Ant and Ivy. Targets are:

* publish - resolve dependencies, build, and install jar files in local repository
* clean - remove all generated and downloaded files

Then compile the native binding in directory csrc/ using make. Edit
the Makefile and change it according to your local installation of
Java, Spread and FlushSpread.

3. Credits
----------

The Spread implementation of the jGCS service was developed by:

 - Jose' Pereira <jop@di.uminho.pt>
 - Nuno Carvalho <nunomrc@di.fc.ul.pt>

Research leading to this implementation was partially funded by the
European Union. People involved were N. Carvalho, J. Pereira,
L. Rodrigues and R. Oliveira.
